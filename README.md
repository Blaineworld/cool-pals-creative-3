# CPC 3.0: The In-Place Rewrite

CPC 3.0 is CPC 2.0 rewritten and reworked. I've removed and replaced certain
features, generally enhanced others, and made the whole thing public on GitHub.
The best part? I didn't even reset the world this time! (That's the best part
because nobody really appreciates the work I do on custom features. 🥲
Oh, but you will... very, very soon... I have awesome things planned...)
