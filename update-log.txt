| 3.0.0: The In-Place Rewrite

- removed everything (to replace it with a better version)

UI & HUD Tweaks
 + indicators on waxed and infested blocks in item form
    Waxed blocks have honey, and infested blocks have a silverfish.
 + more compact font
    Most letters are now 4 pixels wide instead of 5.
    You can fit more text in text areas (except books) with this font.
 + more compact and readable coordinate display

Non-Interactive Blocks
 + Artificial Grass
    Fake grass that looks like an old-school grass texture.
    It is not currently treated as a real dirt block by the game.
    It has two variants: Light (Java Alpha) and Dark (PE Alpha).
 + Chiseled and Smooth Purpur
    Data values 1 and 3 of Purpur respectively.
 + Colors
    Solid blocks of every dye color.
    They can be clear, glowing, both, or neither.

Interactive Blocks
 + Spleef Floors
    Magical blocks specifically designed for spleef games!
    When broken, they leave an outline that can be refilled with commands.
    Soft: breaks instantly.
    Tough: breaks in 1 tick. Use the Mining Fatigue effect to adjust this.
    Unstable: breaks when someone walks over it. Kinda like TNT Run!
 + Whopper
    An absolute whopper of a cheeseburger.
    It restores half a hunger thingy when clicked.

Quality-of-Life
 + game rules reset automatically when everyone leaves
    This also includes difficulty and weather.
 + new players spawn with an elytra equipped and fireworks in their hands

Note: Most custom items are not currently available without using commands.
